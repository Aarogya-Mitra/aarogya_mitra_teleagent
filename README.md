# Arogya Mitra Tele‑Agent
Arogya Mitra is an AI-powered healthcare platform connecting patients and doctors.
arogya_mitra_teleagent is the voice-based gateway for patients who do not own a
smartphone. Patients can dial a local number from any basic keypad phone and interact with
an AI agent powered by Vapi, with all workflows handled seamlessly via Make.com (formerly
Integromat)—no custom server is required.

# Key Features
1 Phone‑first access – Works on any keypad/feature phone - no smartphone or app required
2 Conversational AI – Voice-based interaction in local languages powered by Vapi agents
3 No server needed – All backend workflows handled through Make.com scenarios
4 Data integration – All call data (summary, user info, symptoms) stored in a connected database
(Firestore)
